Test coverage
-------------
dialer-app has autopilot tests which cover basic use cases like making an
outgoing call and receiving an incoming call. They are integration tests which
cover dialer-app itself, all the user session APIs below it (libofono-qt,
telephony-service, telepathy-ofono), and the ofono service on the system D-BUS.
They assume that ofono has been set up with the "phonesim" driver to avoid
depending on any particular hardware; if phonesim is not set up, the tests will
be skipped.

The tests should run on both a desktop (like an Ubuntu desktop live session or
Otto [http://launchpad.net/otot]) and a phone environment.

How to run the tests
--------------------
The easiest and standard way across Ubuntu phablet packages is to install the
dialer-app-autopilot package and run the tests from the system Python path:

  sudo apt-get install dialer-app-autopilot
  autopilot run dialer_app

dialer-app-autopilot depends on ofono-phonesim-autostart to set up the
simulated Modem automatically, and all the other additional test dependencies
for autopilot. You can also run the tests right out of the source tree for
development:

  cd tests/autopilot
  autopilot run dialer_app

(but you still need all the dialer-app-autopilot installed).
